# Eli Ewa DSGN-270 Assignment 3 SVG Logo Design

## Design Concept and Journal Entry:

I chose this design with the idea of creating a simple yet memorable design for a sporting goods retailer. I recieved inspiration mainly from the sportchek "checkmark" logo. However, I wanted to make it appear more aggressive, hence the "X" pattern made up of two individual "checkmarks". As far as the color choice, I was inspired by the color of the xbox logo and how it really stands out amongs other logos. Of course with the "theme" being a compass, I wanted to integrate that idea into the overall design as is very common with effective logos. For my two versions displayed, I chose a light/monochromatic version and a dark mode version. I feel these two versions really highlight the simple yet effective nature of this logo and how diverse its usage could be across various mediums. The main problem I encountered during this process was choosing a design that made sense with my idea. In the end after searching through various logo's, I decided that simplicity was the best option so I tried to focus on only using simple geometric shapes and a fairly simple typeface.
